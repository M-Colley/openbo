"""Multi-objective Transfer Acquisition Function (TAF-EHVI).

Multi-objective sibling of ``openbo.acquisition.taf``. The mechanism is deliberately the
same one, lifted from scalar improvement to hypervolume improvement:

    single objective (taf.py)                multi objective (this module)
    -------------------------------------    -------------------------------------------
    EI_target(x)                             qLogNEHVI_target(x)
    softplus(mu_i(x) - ref_i)                log HVI of mu_i(x) vs source i's Pareto front
    TAF-M: Epanechnikov over meta-features    same, with MO meta-features
    TAF-R: mis-ordered observation PAIRS      mis-ordered PER-OBJECTIVE pairs (default), or
                                             mis-classified Pareto RELATIONS (ablation)
    [w_t*T + sum w_i*S_i] / [w_t + sum w_i]  same, evaluated in log space

    TAF-R ships in two variants. ``compute_taf_r_ranking_weights`` (the default, weight mode
    "taf_r") scores each observation pair once PER OBJECTIVE, so a pair that is mutually
    non-dominated -- the common case near a Pareto front -- still contributes M rankings of
    evidence. ``compute_taf_r_pareto_weights`` (weight mode "taf_r_pareto", kept for
    ablation) scores each pair once via its Pareto dominance relation, which discards
    exactly those pairs and can leave the similarity estimate starved of evidence.

Two properties of the scalar version are preserved exactly because they are what make the
mechanism work:

1. A source contributes through its posterior MEAN only; its variance is discarded. A source
   is a deterministic "prior utility surface", not a calibrated belief.
2. Sources whose weight is <= 0 leave BOTH the numerator and the denominator, so a rejected
   source cannot dilute the target term (matches ``taf_m_acquisition``).

The blend is computed as ``logsumexp`` of the log-weighted terms minus ``log`` of the weight
sum. Because ``logsumexp([log a, log b]) == log(a + b)`` exactly, this is the logarithm of the
scalar version's weighted average -- not an approximation of it. Log space is required rather
than merely convenient: the non-log hypervolume improvement of a dominated candidate is
identically zero with a zero gradient, which strands a gradient-based acquisition optimizer,
whereas the log form keeps a finite, monotonically decreasing "how far behind the front"
signal.

    evaluated on the target's observed values and on the source's posterior mean, and the
    disagreement distance for source s is the label mismatch rate over ALL comparisons:

        d_s = (1 / (M * C(n, 2))) * sum_{i<j} sum_m 1[ r_ijm^target != r_ijm^source ]

    The denominator is fixed at M * C(n, 2): a tie is a ranking claim of its own, so a
    strict order asserted against a tie counts as a (full) mismatch rather than being
    skipped. Ties are detected with a small absolute tolerance because exact float
    equality is brittle for GP posterior means.

    This replaces Pareto-dominance agreement (``compute_taf_r_pareto_weights``) as the
    default because dominance relations under-inform the similarity estimate: pairs near
    the Pareto front are typically mutually non-dominated, which the dominance view must
    treat as "incomparable" even though each such pair still carries M usable per-objective
    rankings (e.g. [0.1, 0.2] vs [0.4, 0.1]: no dominance, yet objective 1 clearly ranks
    x2 > x1 and objective 2 ranks x1 > x2). In the extreme -- every observation on a
    trade-off curve -- dominance agreement collects zero evidence and returns the null
    result, while this estimator still scores M rankings per pair. It is also cheaper:
    sign comparisons only, no dominance determination.

    One guard sits on top of the formula, mirroring the scalar module's zero-comparable-
    pairs rule and the Pareto variant's source_strict rule: a source that asserts a strict
    order on fewer than ``min_informative_pairs`` comparisons (e.g. a flat surrogate, all
    labels 0) is weighted 0.0 outright. The formula alone would hand such a source
    d_s = 1 against an informative target -- which still earns weight once rho > 1 -- and
    d_s = 0 (FULL weight) against a degenerate all-tied target, despite it carrying no
    ranking information in either case.

    Remaining degenerate cases follow the single-objective module: no sources -> empty,
    fewer than two observations -> normalized uniform (no ranking evidence yet), and all
    weights underflowing -> zeros so the acquisition falls back to the target term alone.
